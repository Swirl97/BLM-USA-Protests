<h2> Project Description </h2>
This map shows the cities where Black Lives Matter protests are happening at. This is an interactive story map of the most recent news of specific cities as of `June 10th, 2020`. I wanted to show headlines of different places in the United States because I find that knowing what the current media is saying about Black Lives Matter is important. I personally believe that media displays information differently than what is going on but it still is important to see the media's perspective.
